# Project Brief: Challonge Clone

## Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of this project is to modernize the `challonge-clone` application's frontend. This involves aligning its UI/UX and features with a reference repository: `https://github.com/evroon/bracket`.

The main objectives are:
- Implement a responsive, modern UI/UX.
- Ensure the application is functional and bug-free.
- Replicate key features and design patterns from the reference project.

The project is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
