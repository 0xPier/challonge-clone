# Progress

## What Works

- User authentication (registration and login).
- Basic routing and page structure.
- The main layout is applied to most pages.

## What's Left to Build

- A fully responsive and functional UI.
- The tournament creation and management features.
- The tournament bracket visualization.
- The leaderboard and user profile pages.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the early stages of development. The main focus is on fixing the responsive layout issues before moving on to implementing the core features.

## Known Issues

- The `Navbar` and `Sidebar` components are not rendering correctly on different screen sizes.
- The mobile menu is not functional.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The initial approach to the responsive layout was incorrect and is being refactored.
- The `isMenuOpen` state has been centralized in the `Layout.tsx` component to ensure a single source of truth.
